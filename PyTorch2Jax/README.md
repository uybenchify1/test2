# PyTorch to Jax Conversion

This example illustrates how Benchify can be used to test the equivalence of two austensibly equivalent functions.  In this case, the customer translated some code from PyTorch to Jax, and wanted to make sure that the two implementations were functionally equivalent.  Thank you to [Nithin Santi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nithinsonti/) for contributing this example!
